# Oepfelbaum Tech Assessment

A warm welcome dear techie. This repository should allow you to get s first technical briefing of your upcoming task.

## üìà The Process
The process will roughly be as follows:

| Step| Eplanation | Duration | Participants |
|----|----|----|----|
| **Kick-Off**| Meeting to get you up and going. We will present you the business requirements and you will have the first chance to get to know us & ask questions. | approx. 0.5h | You, a Software Engineer and a Business Engineer
| **Project** | Freely schedulable timeframe to work on the project and the business requirements. | approx. 4 active hours / 1 week total | You (and us on hold in case you have any questions!)
| **Presentation** | Your time to shine! Present us with your work and make our jaws drop. Do your free to do this in any form you see suited, but a demo is always nice! This is also a good point for you to ask any questions about Oepfelbaum. | approx. 1h | The same people as in the kick-off
| **Review** | We will have a closer look at your submission and discuss the results | approx. 2 days | Oepfelbaum
| **Feedback** | We give you detailed feedback and tell you about the next steps | ? | You & your recruiting contact

## üöß  The Project
In this technical assessment, you will be developing a small client-facing & web-based banking application using the open banking API standards.
You are pretty much free to design your application, as long as you stick to the following requirements.

Please be aware that the time-frame for this project is tight.
It is essential that you focus on the main requirements in the first place and to not get distracted by any fancy but non-essentail (or required) features.
We do not expect you to develop a production-ready application during this project.
During the presentation you will be given the opportunity to explain any additional step you would do, if you had the time.

### üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
Before the kick-off meeting, please make sure to have prepared the following:
* [Create NatWest Sandbox Account](https://auth.sandbox.natwest.com/auth/realms/NatWestPortal/protocol/openid-connect/registrations?client_id=devportal&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.sandbox.natwest.com%2F&state=191b2e6f-528f-4ec6-8610-225e815ba850&response_mode=fragment&response_type=code&scope=openid&nonce=ea56482f-8f42-4167-a1d6-9a440c03998f&code_challenge=lEzU2zGpUC6qxYsyJCTLv6oDHLBwV5SQUtHBOD0WAdE&code_challenge_method=S256)
* Have your favorite IDE & tools up and running (remember our tech stack)
* Prepare any questions you might need to have answered before you start

### üìã Requirements

#### Technical
* Use the NatWest Sandbox to access data ([Documentation](https://developer.sandbox.natwest.com/documentation/), [Test Data](https://developer.sandbox.natwest.com/documentation/devPortal/testdata))
* Create a Web-Facing Application
* Stay around our tech-stack
* Ensure runnable code
* Make me laugh (on purpose)

#### Business
The business requirements will be presented to you during the kick-off session. Stay tuned for that!

### üö´ Out-of-Scope
We are sure you are aware of our **tech-stack** and that of our clients. So please stick with that!

The time-frame is too tight to do proper **Authorization & Authentication**. So we do not expect you to work on that.

Focus on a web-facing application and do not try to create some hybrid web/app application.
### üì¶ Deliverables
* Source Code
  * Make sure it is runnable
  * Include any developer documentation on how to run your application (prerequisites, etc.)
* Git History
  * We would like to see your work process here
* List of Future Work & Missing Pieces
  * What is missing?
  * Where to improve?
* Presentation
  * Tell us about your work
  * Show us your work (demo?)
  * Reflect about your work
  * No slides necessary for this. Just be prepared ;-)

## üßê Final words
Please note, that the 4 active hours for the project are an approximation.
If you do want to spend an extra hour to go the extra mile, we won't mind.
But we absolutely do not expect you to work a whole day on this project.


We are all very much looking forward to your submission and your presentation. We really hope you will enjoy this challenge as much as we did. And please feel free to contact us at any time, when you are stuck and could need some help or clarification!
