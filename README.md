# üçé Oepfelbaum Tech Assessment

A warm welcome dear Techie. This repository covers the main information from your Tech Assessment - please read carefully.

&nbsp;
## üìà The Process
The process will roughly be as follows:

| Step| Explanation | Duration | Participants |
|----|----|----|----|
| **Sprint Kick-Off**| Briefing to get you up and going. The business analyst will present the business requirements. Feel free to raise any questions if applicable. | max. 0.5h | You and the Business Analyst from your project team
| **Sprint** | Freely schedulable timeframe to work on the project and the business requirements. | approx. 4-5 active hours / 1 week total | You (and us on hold in case you have any questions!)
| **Sprint Review** | Your time to shine! Present us your work in any suitable way of your choice. This is also a good chance to ask any questions re Oepfelbaum. | approx. 1h | The same people as in the kick-off
| **Internal Review** | We will have a closer look at your submission and discuss the results | approx. 2 days | Oepfelbaum
| **Feedback** | We provide you a detailed feedback and inform you about the next steps | approx. 0.5h | You & your recruiting contact

&nbsp;
## üöß  The Project
In this technical assessment, you will be developing a small client-facing & web-based banking application using the open banking API standards.
You are pretty much free to design your application, as long as you stick to the requirements provided during the Sprint Kick-off as well as the information provided on this page.


&nbsp;
### üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
Before the kick-off meeting, please make sure to have prepared the following:
* [Create NatWest Sandbox Account](https://auth.sandbox.natwest.com/auth/realms/NatWestPortal/protocol/openid-connect/registrations?client_id=devportal&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.sandbox.natwest.com%2F&state=191b2e6f-528f-4ec6-8610-225e815ba850&response_mode=fragment&response_type=code&scope=openid&nonce=ea56482f-8f42-4167-a1d6-9a440c03998f&code_challenge=lEzU2zGpUC6qxYsyJCTLv6oDHLBwV5SQUtHBOD0WAdE&code_challenge_method=S256)
* Have your favorite IDE & tools up and running (remember our tech stack)
* Prepare any questions you might need to have answered before you start

&nbsp;
### üìã Requirements
#### Technical
* Use the NatWest Sandbox to access data ([Documentation](https://developer.sandbox.natwest.com/documentation/), [Test Data](https://developer.sandbox.natwest.com/documentation/devPortal/testdata)) 
* Create a Web-Facing Application
* Stay around our tech-stack (Just use what you see suited for this task and the provided time-frame.)
* Ensure runnable code
* Bonus: Surprise us or make us laugh!

#### Business
The business requirements will be presented to you during the kick-off session. Stay tuned for that!

&nbsp;
### üö´ Out-of-Scope
We are sure you are aware of our **tech-stack** and that of our clients. 
So please stick with that!
But there is no need to use all technologies listed in our tech-stack. 
Just use what you see suited for the task and what allows you to rapidly work on fulfilling the requirements.

The time-frame is too tight to do proper **Authorization & Authentication**. So we do not expect you to work on that.
Please also note, that the open-banking servers are using a specific SSL-Certificate, which will most likely not be trusted by your browser.
You may thus want to build up a custom proxy or manually add the [certificates provided by Open Banking](https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/252018873/OB+Root+and+Issuing+Certificates+for+Sandbox).

Focus on a web-facing application and do not try to create some hybrid web/app application.

&nbsp;
### üì¶ Deliverables
* Source Code
  * Make sure it is runnable
  * Include any developer documentation on how to run your application (prerequisites, etc.)
* Git History
  * We would like to see your work process here
* List of Future Work & Missing Pieces
  * What is missing?
  * Where to improve?
* Presentation
  * Tell us about your work
  * Show us your work (demo?)
  * Reflect about your work
  * Choose your own way and tools to present - nobody really cares about slides if you show off the final result instead :grin:

## :point_right: Helpful hints and tricks
<b>Work-Life Balance</b> is an essential thing at Oepfelbaum: Please take as much time as required to code the solution but take breaks and manage your time wisely. 
- Focus on the main requirements before implementing any additional features you have in mind to impress us even further.
- We expect a good software engineer to implement the feature within 4 hours, take this as an estimate but do it at your own pace
- If you get stuck at some point we are happy to support <i>as time allows</i>. 
- If you won't manage to implement all requirements or have production ready code in time <b>don't worry!</b> We are happy to hear about the challenges you faced during the sprint at the sprint review.
- During the presentation leave some time to let us know about what you would do next if the project would go on such as additional features or technical refinements.
&nbsp;
### :grinning: Enjoy the time!
We are all very much looking forward to your submission and your presentation. We really hope you will enjoy this challenge as much as we did. And once more, please feel free to contact us at any time, when you are stuck and could need some help or clarification!
