# Oepfelbaum Tech Assessment

A warm welcome dear techie. This repository should allow you to get s first technical briefing of your upcoming task.

## The Process
The process will roughly be as follows:

| Step| Eplanation | Duration | Participants |
|----|----|----|----|
| **Kick-Off**| Meeting to get you up and going. We will present you the business requirements and you will have the first chance to get to know us & ask questions. | approx. 0.5h | You, a Software Engineer and a Business Engineer
| **Project** | Freely schedulable timeframe to work on the project and the business requirements. | approx. 4 active hours / 1 week total | You (and us on hold in case you have any questions!)
| **Presentation** | Your time to shine! Present us with your work and make our jaws drop. Do your free to do this in any form you see suited, but a demo is always nice! This is also a good point for you to ask any questions about Oepfelbaum. | approx. 1h | The same people as in the kick-off
| **Review** | We will have a closer look at your submission and discuss the results | approx. 2 days | Oepfelbaum
| **Feedback** | We give you detailed feedback and tell you about the next steps | ? | You & your recruiting contact

## The Project
In this technical assessment, you will be developing a small client-facing & web-based banking application using the open banking API standards.
You are pretty much free to design your application, as long as you stick to the following requirements.

Please be aware that the time-frame for this project is tight.
It is essential that you focus on the main requirements in the first place and to not get distracted by any fancy but non-essentail (or required) features.
We do not expect you to develop a production-ready application during this project.
During the presentation you will be given the opportunity to explain any additional step you would do, if you had the time.
